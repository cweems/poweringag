Recognized as a fast-growing and largely sustainable raw material, there is an increasing global demand for bamboo as a wood substitute for a variety of construction and furnishing applications.  However, bamboo resources are often poorly managed. Most engaged in the industry have limited knowledge of modern value-added processing techniques, which limit their earning potential.  As such, there is an opportunity to use new clean energy technologies in treating bamboo, so a broader market penetration can be achieved.</p><p><em>Clean Energy Solution:</em> African Bamboo is developing an environmentally friendly bamboo thermal modification process called ThermoBoo. Though this chemical-free process, decay factors such as rot and insects are virtually eliminated, and the thermally modified bamboo fiber can then be further processed into sturdy panels that can be marketed to a range of domestic and international buyers. The ThermoBoo process involves the combustion of biomass dust – a technological approach that is completely new to Ethiopia. Through the project’s successful implementation of a pilot processing facility, African Bamboo envisions developing a replicable model that can lead to prospective business opportunities throughout the region.  African Bamboo will continue to work with farmers and processors to ensure the modified bamboo products meet internationally recognized standards.</p><p><em>Impact:</em> The success of this project will develop new opportunities for export, employment, and manufacturing in Ethiopia.  In addition to its socio-economic impact, bamboo cultivation of native species plays a significant role in environmental protection. African Bamboo incorporates environmental impact assessments to ensure continued promotion of bamboo’s environmental benefits and the minimization of the company’s ecological footprint. </p><p>African Bamboo is a forestry, wood, and bio-energy company located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

For example, 15 percent of the global tuna catch in 2009 came from Indonesia. However, few feasible refrigeration options are available, which results in an estimated 35% spoilage of the fish caught. Cold-chain facilities that do exist are primarily powered by expensive diesel. Vast opportunities exist to harness solar power to empower communities with new options for cold storage of the fishing catch. </p><p><em>Clean Energy Solutions:</em> Experience International, Inc. (EI) will install Contained Energy (CE)’s solar cold storage and ice units in remote fishing communities in Eastern Indonesia.  The refrigeration system uses photovoltaic (PV) arrays to power direct current (DC) compressors. Cooling from the compressors is captured in ‘thermal storage modules’ made from phase change materials. This system avoids the need for large battery banks which are more expensive and associated with higher maintenance costs. This concept has a significant positive impact on life-time cost of ownership which will make financing of the installations more feasible. Experience International (EI) will build the capacity of local fishing associations to manage and generate revenue from the facilities. Key to the project’s success will be EI’s demonstration of a profitable business model in solar cold chain systems, and its ability to link potential owners with appropriate sources of financing in the region. </p><p>The project will collaborate with the USAID-funded Indonesia Marine and Climate Support (IMACS) Project to target fishing communities with the greatest need for, and the highest capacity to manage, the solar-powered cold-storage installations. Also important to the project’s proposed activities is information from a complementary grant activity funded by the Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP), of which the US Department of State is a member.  The REEEP grant is to study the potential for viable solar-powered cold-storage and ice-making installations for fishing ports in under-serviced areas of Indonesia. </p><p><em>Impact:</em> Cold storage is essential in the fishing industry, and this innovation has social, economic, and health benefits for fisherman and their families. Fish is the main source of protein in Indonesia and cold storage makes this resource more accessible and safer to eat. In fishing families where women often work side-by-side with their husbands completing tasks from sewing nets to sorting the day’s catch, reduced spoilage will increase incomes, expand distribution, and ultimately improve the livelihood security for these families and their communities.   </p><p>This USAID Powering Agriculture Grand Challenge Grant activity is being carried out through a partnership between Experience International, Inc. and Contained Energy.

This deficiency in the distribution chain results in less than half of the milk produced reaching dairy processors. Of the milk that is processed, up to 30% of it may spoil without appropriate cold-storage options.  Consequently, many dairy farmers and processors unnecessarily may lose significant earning potential from their operations. Of the milk that does arrive, much of it has a high bacterial count due to lack of refrigeration, and this results in poor quality dairy products. Farmers can receive a premium price for providing higher quality, refrigerated milk to dairy processors. Dairy processors can also charge a premium for better quality and tasting dairy products if the milk can be chilled from farm to factory.</p><p><em>Clean Energy Solution:</em> Recognizing the need for affordable cold-chain technologies, SunDanzer is developing a small-scale portable cooling system tailored for use in the Kenyan dairy market.  The system comprises a photo-voltaic refrigerator (PVR) that uses solar energy to cool a chest refrigerator.  This technology may use a battery for energy storage or phase-change material or a combination of both.  SunDanzer will evaluate freezing phase-change material into ‘milk packs’. The portable ‘milk packs’ retain their cold temperature overnight, and in the morning, farmers use them to keep the collected milk cold in sterilized aluminum milk containers.  When the frozen sterilized ‘milk packs’ are submerged, the stored milk is chilled on the farm and stays cold when transported to the dairy processing facilities. The PVR system can also be used at milk collection centers and at processing facilities for further reduction in spoilage rates before sale, as well as reducing initial “pull-down” refrigeration loads.  </p><p><em>Sundanzer in collaboration with Winrock International will work with dairy cooperatives and established micro-finance institutions (MFIs) to provide financing for farmers who are interested in investing the PVR systems.  To increase dairy farmers’ access to the technology, SunDanzer is working to develop an expanded dealer network in the dairy-producing Nakuru region of Kenya to sell PVRs, train technicians, and supply maintenance parts.  </p><p><em>Impact:</em> Kenya is slated by the World Bank to reach middle income status by 2025; while the Kenya Dairy Master Plan envisages that per capita milk consumption will double to 220 kg. by 2030 – an annual growth rate of almost 8 percent.  This clean energy solution, which aims to increase dairy farm productivity and income significantly by decreasing milk spoilage, will help to achieve these important national milestones.  Effective cold-chain storage lowers bacteria count and improves milk quality for consumers. These improvements can play a major role in the livelihoods of approximately 1 million smallholder dairy farming families in Kenya.</p><p><em>SunDanzer has 14 years’ of experience with off-grid refrigeration needs, including developing the world’s first battery-free solar powered refrigerator.

The team will then work with local manufacturers to secure financing and bring production of the refrigeration systems to commercial scale.  </p><p><em>Impact:</em> The social, economic, and environmental benefits to this project are intertwined. Milk coolers will benefit dairy farmers by decreasing milk spoilage and increasing production and profits. These benefits will be felt all along the value chain. Biogas used for lighting and cooking saves income that would otherwise be spent on kerosene and replaces the use of wood and charcoal for cooking, which is shrinking in availability as Uganda’s forests are depleted. Also, by extracting biogas from cow manure, greenhouse gas emission from fermenting cow manure is mitigated.</p><p><em>UGARF is a 501 (c) (3) organization separate from the University of Georgia. It serves the University of Georgia (UGA) and enhances its excellence as a research institution by serving as the legal recipient of contracts and grants from industry, public and private non-profits, and government agencies for the performance of research and education. (May want to include information on smallholder farmer activities)</p>"
